# My Personal Project - Soccer Team Constructor

## Purpose of application and target audience:

**Purpose**

This application serves to allow the user to construct soccer teams, 
with different formations, where the user inputs the different players making up
the teams 11 players.

**Target Audience**

This application is for anyone who is a soccer fan and wants to visualize different
team options. Potential users may also include coaches who would like to explore 
various team formations and compositions - allowing them to have a better understanding
of how the team fits together.

**Why this project is of interest to me**

As a lifelong soccer fan, I want to work on a project which I could see myself using 
for fun. I anticipate using the application myself for the purposes of my own soccer
team, to explore and put into practice different team compositions, as well as using it
to recreate some of my favourite professional teams.
